## Make music with code. In your browser.

Sonic Web is a browser-native reimplementation of [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)'s live coding engine. Same Ruby DSL. Same synths. Same samples. No install.

I built this because Sonic Pi changed how I think about music and code, and I wanted that experience to be one click away for anyone with a browser.

All thanks to:
- **Sonic Pi** & Sam Aaron — for proving that code is a musical instrument
- **SuperSonic** — the WebAssembly port of SuperCollider that makes real synthesis possible in the browser
- **AudioWorklet** — the browser API that makes low-latency audio processing work
- **Algorave community** — for building a culture where live coding is performance art

## The core idea: `sleep` as a scheduler-controlled Promise

Ruby's `sleep` blocks the thread. JavaScript can't — block the main thread and the UI freezes. Previous browser ports either gave up on multi-loop timing or simulated it with `setTimeout`, which drifts under load.

The trick we landed on: `sleep` returns a Promise that **only the VirtualTimeScheduler can resolve**. User code `await`s the sleep; the scheduler advances virtual time and resolves Promises in deterministic order. The result is cooperative concurrency with virtual time across any number of `live_loop`s, with audio events scheduled ahead of the AudioWorklet callback so they stay sample-accurate.

This means the JS engine inherits Sonic Pi's full temporal model — `sync`, `cue`, `time_warp`, `with_fx`, hot-swap — not a simplified approximation.

- **Ruby DSL → JS via Tree-sitter.** Your Sonic Pi code is parsed into an AST and transpiled to JavaScript builder chains. Full structural awareness of blocks, symbols, and Ruby semantics. No regex hacks.
- **Real SuperCollider synthesis.** Audio runs through SuperSonic (scsynth compiled to WebAssembly via AudioWorklet). Same synth definitions, same sound — not a simplified approximation.

```ruby
live_loop :drums do
  sample :bd_haus
  sleep 0.5
  sample :sn_dub
  sleep 0.5
end
```

Press Run. Now add this while the drums are playing:

```ruby
live_loop :bass do
  use_synth :tb303
  play :e2, release: 0.3, cutoff: rrand(60, 120)
  sleep 0.25
end
```

The bass joins in. Change a number. Hit Run again. The music updates instantly. That's live coding.

## What can I do with it?

**Write Sonic Pi code** — the same Ruby DSL you know from desktop. `live_loop`, `play`, `sleep`, `sample`, `with_fx`, `use_synth`, `sync`, `cue` — it all works.

**Perform live** — 10 buffers, hot-swap on Re-run, Alt+R/Alt+S shortcuts, fullscreen mode, spectrum visualizer. Built for the stage.

**Teach** — zero setup means students open a URL and start coding. Friendly error messages with line numbers. Built-in examples from simple beats to full compositions.

**Embed anywhere** — drop the engine into any web page, LMS, or creative coding tool as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mjayb/sonicweb).

---

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Just open the website

**[sonicweb.cc](https://sonicweb.cc)** — nothing to install.

### Option 2: Run locally

```bash
npx @mjayb/sonicweb@beta
```

### Option 3: Embed in your app

```bash
npm install @mjayb/sonicweb@beta
```

```ts
import { SonicPiEngine } from '@mjayb/sonicweb'

const engine = new SonicPiEngine()
await engine.init()
await engine.evaluate(`
  live_loop :beat do
    sample :bd_haus
    sleep 0.5
  end
`)
engine.play()
```

No wiring needed — the engine loads SuperSonic (the GPL scsynth WASM core, from
CDN, never bundled), the tree-sitter transpiler, and its PRNG table itself.
Using a `<script type="module">` with **no bundler**? Import the self-contained
browser entry instead: `import { SonicPiEngine } from '@mjayb/sonicweb/browser'`.

## Compatibility with Desktop Sonic Pi

Parity is measured **end-to-end** — not from unit tests alone, but by running each composition on both engines and comparing the result. Real desktop Sonic Pi runs the same `.rb` file over OSC; web runs it through the full pipeline (Ruby → transpile → scheduler → scsynth-WASM → audio); a launch gate then grades the two outputs.

### Parity scores (latest launch gate)

| Metric | Score | What it measures |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Launch gate** | ✅ **PASS** | Overall: roster pass + differential matrix green |
| **Official roster** | **34/34 (100%)** | Non-heavy official examples, PRNG-graded by per-synthdef `/s_new` event-parity (threshold ≥70%) |
| **Differential matrix** | **52/52 cells** | Desktop ↔ web structure-match — 0 diverge / timing / empty / error |
| **Event-parity sweep** | **151 / 154** | Full fixture corpus: 151 EVENT-MATCH · **0 DIVERGE** · 3 non-gradeable by design |
| **Unit tests** | **1491 / 1491** | Vitest, across 68 files (`npx vitest run`) |

The 3 non-gradeable fixtures are excluded by design (a counter probe, a density isolation probe, and a deliberate web-only feature test), not failures. Regenerate the gate yourself with `npx tsx tools/gate-report.ts`; the full per-fixture breakdown lives in `test_results/launch-gate.md`.

### Browse the parity dashboards

Every fixture is browsable in the live **[parity dashboard](https://dashboard-dist-five.vercel.app)** — one overview links the official roster, the differential matrix, per-`/s_new` event-diffs, the launch gate, and the FX A/B inspector, each with desktop ↔ web spectrograms.

Every Ruby snippet on the dashboards is **playable in the browser** — ▶ Run / ■ Stop through the same engine that powers the editor — and carries an **↗ open in sonicweb.cc** link that loads it straight into the live editor. Locally, open `test_results/index.html`, or serve the dashboards with inline audio via `npm run dashboard:serve`.

### Feature coverage

- **63/66 synths** working end-to-end (3 upstream WASM LOAD-FAIL: `dark_sea_horn`, `singer`, `winwood_lead`)
- **197/197 samples**
- **38 FX** wired end-to-end and A/B WAV-verified against desktop (`tools/fx-sweep.ts`). No FX produces silence or wrong audio — every wired FX routes signal; differences are level/spectral-shape, not engine bugs. (`delay` and `chorus` are excluded — the upstream SuperSonic WASM synthdef package doesn't ship them, [#301](https://github.com/MrityunjayBhardwaj/SonicWeb/issues/301).)
- **~148/170 DSL functions** (~87% of upstream's user-facing surface)

**Identical to desktop:** seeded PRNG (Mersenne Twister), synth definitions, sample library, music theory, timing semantics, hot-swap, sync/cue.

**Different in the browser:**
- Audio output is calibrated for browser WASM headroom (Sonic Tau's gain staging, `pre_amp=0.3`, `amp=0.8`), not Desktop SP's driver-attenuated levels. Comparator tools should RMS-normalise before A/B.
- OSC output requires a host-provided transport (hook-based) — browsers can't open raw UDP sockets.
- MIDI is wired internally but the device-picker UI ships in v1.6 (Tier D). Web MIDI works for input.
- No filesystem access — sample paths from directories, `eval_file`, and user samples from disk are out of scope until the browser sandbox model changes.

See [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for permanent constraints and [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for current beta-blocker bugs.

### How does this compare to Sonic Tau?

[Sonic Tau](https://sonic-pi.net/tau/) is Sam Aaron's official next-gen Sonic Pi for the browser, built on Elixir + Phoenix LiveView. Sonic Web is an independent JS-native engine you can `npm install` and embed in any web page. Tau is the future of the Sonic Pi project; this is for embedding the live-coding model into your own apps, courses, and tools.
