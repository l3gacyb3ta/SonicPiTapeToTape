   * "music plays wrongly" residual on Update; the same race exists on first
   * Run but is masked because the user just clicked Play).
   *
   * Why this fixes it: FX nodes are CREATED HERE with audioTime=0 (immediate).
   * scsynth processes them now, BEFORE any future-timed sample bundle can
   * land. By the time loops start iterating, persistentFx is populated, the
   * lazy-creation block at line 612 is skipped via .has(), and task.outBus
   * is set to the live FX bus before any sample plays.
   *
   * Why only FX (not samples): FX are bus receivers — they must exist before
   * audio flows through them. Samples are continuous per-iteration events
   * scheduled via virtual time; pre-creating them would block real-time
   * scheduling. FX setup is one-time per scope.
   *
   * Idempotent: scopes already in `persistentFx` are skipped.
