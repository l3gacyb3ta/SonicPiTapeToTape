/**
 * Static component scan — extract the LITERAL sample / FX / synth names a
 * piece of user code references, without building or running it. The
 * pre-Run path of the preflight EPIC (#318, child #318.3 / #323).
 *
 * Why static (not the #321 Step-walker): loop Programs are built lazily
 * per-iteration inside the scheduler (`SonicPiEngine.ts:694`); there is no
 * pre-Run moment where Step[]s exist, and re-running builderFn to get them
 * is an SP72 build-phase-state-mutation hazard. A textual scan of the user
 * code is the only side-effect-free pre-Run option. The result feeds the
 * unchanged `ComponentResolver` (#322) — same `ComponentManifest` shape.
 *
 * BOUNDED BY DESIGN: only LITERAL names are found —
 *   `sample :x` / `sample "x"` / `sample('x')`
 *   `use_synth :x` · `synth :x` · `with_fx :x`  (and quoted/paren forms)
 * Runtime-computed names (`sample SAMPS.tick`, a name from a variable) are
 * deliberately NOT found: they cannot be known pre-Run, so they are not
 * preflighted and not blocked — they fall back to normal lazy-load (which,
 * post-#320/#317, self-heals on transient failure). This is the precise,
 * intended limit, not a gap to paper over. Literal names are exactly the
 * set that bites users (typos, SP89 never-shipped names are always literal).
 *
 * Over-collection is harmless (a real, loadable name just resolves).
 * Under-collection of a literal, or collecting a name from a COMMENT,
 * is not: a commented-out `sample :typo` must never block Run — so
 * comments are stripped before scanning.

/**

 * no real comment will truncate that line early — acceptable because the
 * DSL forms we scan (`sample :x` etc.) do not use `#` in their literal
 * name, and the failure mode is under-collection of that one line, which
 * degrades to lazy-load (no false-block, no regression). `#{}`
 * interpolation is preserved (only `#` NOT followed by `{` starts a
