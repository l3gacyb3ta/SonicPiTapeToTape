/**
 * Engine-level Time State tests (SV47 / #350 / SP95(d) slice 2).

 * Companion to TimeState.test.ts (pure store) and SyncCue.test.ts (sync/cue

 * contract at the SonicPiEngine level — exercising the full pipeline
 * (Sandbox → transpile → ProgramBuilder.set/get → eager TimeState write →
 * scheduler causation → microtask-ordered get read) in one shot.
 *
 * The pre-mortem (e) gate (PLAN-350-timestate.md): the cross-loop reader's
 * post-sync get must read the writer's same-vt set FOR BOTH declaration
 * orders — proving correctness rests on causation (cuer applies its set
 * before yielding; syncer's get is a microtask after the yield) + the
 * time-index, NOT on insertionOrder / source order / which asyncFn the
 * scheduler resumes first. The reorder-invariant variant is the HARD gate
 * the v1 plan lacked.
