# Getting Started with SonicPi.js

SonicPi.js lets you make music by writing code in your browser. No downloads, no installs -- just open the page and start playing.

Based on [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) by Sam Aaron.

---

## Launch

**Option A:** Run locally with Node.js:

```
npx sonicpijs
```

**Option B:** Visit [sonicweb.cc](https://sonicweb.cc) (hosted, zero install).

Once it loads, you will see a code editor with a welcome program already written.
Press **Run** (or **Ctrl+Enter**) to hear it. Press **Stop** (or **Escape**) to silence everything.

---

## Your First Beat

### Step 1: Play a single note

Type this into the editor and press Run:

```ruby
play 60
```

You should hear a beep. That is MIDI note 60 -- middle C.

### Step 2: Add timing

```ruby
play 60
sleep 0.5
play 64
sleep 0.5
play 67
```

`sleep 0.5` waits half a beat before playing the next note. Without sleep, all notes would fire at the same instant.

### Step 3: Add drums

```ruby
sample :bd_haus
sleep 0.5
sample :sn_dub
sleep 0.5
```

Samples are pre-recorded sounds. `:bd_haus` is a bass drum, `:sn_dub` is a snare.

### Step 4: Make it loop

```ruby
live_loop :drums do
  sample :bd_haus
  sleep 0.5
  sample :sn_dub
  sleep 0.5
end
```

`live_loop` repeats the code inside it forever. Give each loop a unique name (`:drums` here).

### Step 5: Live code!

While the loop is playing, change `0.5` to `0.25` and press Run again. The beat speeds up -- instantly. That is live coding. Change code while the music plays.

end
```

Nest effects for chains:

```ruby
with_fx :reverb, room: 0.8 do

## Control Flow

### Conditional play

```ruby
live_loop :maybe do
  if one_in(3)
    sample :bd_haus
  else
    sample :hat_snap
  end
  sleep 0.25
end
```

### Repetition

```ruby
3.times do
  play 60
  sleep 0.25
end
```

### Iterating

```ruby
[:c4, :e4, :g4, :c5].each do |note|
  play note
  sleep 0.25
end
```

### Reusable functions

```ruby
define :bass_hit do |note|
  use_synth :tb303
  play note, release: 0.2, cutoff: 70
end

bass_hit :e2
sleep 0.5
bass_hit :g2
```

### Time compression

```ruby
density 2 do
  # Everything inside plays twice as fast
  play 60
  sleep 0.5
  play 64
  sleep 0.5
end
```

### Parallel voices

```ruby
in_thread do
  # This runs at the same time as the code below
  play 60
  sleep 1
end

play 72
sleep 1
```

### Time offsets

```ruby
at [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5] do |t|
  play 60
end
```

### Coordinating loops

```ruby
live_loop :drums do
  sample :bd_haus
  sleep 0.5
  cue :tick
  sample :sn_dub
  sleep 0.5
end

live_loop :bass do
  sync :tick
  use_synth :tb303
  play :e2, release: 0.3
  sleep 0.5
end
```

`cue` sends a signal. `sync` waits for it. This keeps loops locked together.

---

## Random and Variation

Randomness makes patterns feel alive:

```ruby
# Random float between 60 and 72
play rrand(60, 72)

# Random integer between 60 and 72
play rrand_i(60, 72)

# Pick one from a list
play choose([:c4, :e4, :g4])

# True with 1-in-3 chance
sample :hat_snap if one_in(3)

# Reproducible randomness (same "random" sequence every run)
use_random_seed 42
```

### List operations

```ruby
notes = [:c4, :e4, :g4, :b4]

notes.shuffle    # Random order
notes.reverse    # Backwards
notes.pick(3)    # Pick 3 random elements
```

---

## Recording

1. Click the **Rec** button in the toolbar (it will turn red).
2. Press **Run** and play your music.
3. Click **Rec** again to stop recording.
4. A WAV file will be saved to your downloads folder.

---

## 10 Buffers

The tab bar at the top shows 10 numbered buffers (0-9). Each buffer holds different code, like having 10 separate scratch pads.

- Click a buffer tab to switch to it.
- Each buffer remembers its code between switches.
- Use different buffers for different experiments, or combine them in a performance.

---

## Examples

The Examples menu contains 10 built-in programs organized by difficulty. Load one to learn a technique, then modify it.

### Beginner

| Example | What it teaches |
|---------|----------------|
| **Hello Beep** | The simplest program -- three notes in sequence |
| **Basic Beat** | A four-on-the-floor drum pattern with kick and snare |
| **Ambient Pad** | Slow chord washes with reverb using `:prophet` synth |

### Intermediate

| Example | What it teaches |
|---------|----------------|
| **Arpeggio** | Rising notes using `ring` and `tick` -- a signature Sonic Pi pattern |
| **Euclidean Rhythm** | Spreading hits evenly across steps with `spread` |
| **Random Melody** | Seeded randomness for deterministic but surprising melodies |
| **Multi-Layer** | Three simultaneous loops -- drums, bass, and lead together |

### Advanced

| Example | What it teaches |
|---------|----------------|
| **Sync/Cue** | Two loops synchronized -- the bass waits for the drums |
| **FX Chain** | Nested effects -- reverb wrapping distortion |
| **Minimal Techno** | A full techno track with Euclidean hi-hats and acid bass |

## Differences from Desktop Sonic Pi

SonicPi.js aims to be compatible with the desktop version's Ruby DSL. Here is what to know:

**Works the same:**
- `play`, `sleep`, `sample`, `live_loop`, `in_thread`
- `use_synth`, `with_fx`, `use_bpm`
- `chord`, `scale`, `ring`, `tick`
- `sync`, `cue`, `at`, `density`
- `spread` (Euclidean rhythms)
- Ruby-style syntax (`:symbols`, `do...end` blocks, `.times`, `.each`)

**Different:**
- Runs in the browser using WebAudio + SuperSonic (scsynth compiled to WebAssembly), not a native SuperCollider server.
- Synth and sample sets are limited to those listed above. Desktop Sonic Pi has a larger library.
- **Random values differ from desktop.** `rrand`, `choose`, `one_in`, `use_random_seed` etc. are fully deterministic and seed-stable *within* SonicPi.js — the same seed always produces the same sequence here. But the actual values are **not** identical to desktop Sonic Pi: desktop replays a frozen random-number table, while SonicPi.js computes a live Mersenne Twister (MT19937). So a randomness-driven piece (e.g. `play scale(:c, :minor).choose`) sounds *different* from desktop — same shape, different notes. Matching desktop's exact random stream is a deliberate non-goal for v1.
- Audio latency depends on your browser. Chrome typically performs best.
- MIDI and OSC output are not yet supported.
- `run_file` and `load_sample` from disk are not available in the browser.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No sound?**
- Click Run (or press Ctrl+Enter). Browsers require a user gesture before playing audio.
- Check that your system volume is up and the correct audio output is selected.

**Error message in the console?**
- Read it! Error messages are written in plain language and usually tell you exactly what is wrong.
- "Unknown synth" or "Unknown sample" means you used a name that is not in the lists above. Check your spelling.

**Code runs but sounds wrong?**
- Make sure every `play` or `sample` is followed by a `sleep`. Without sleep, everything plays at once.
- Check your `live_loop` has a `sleep` inside it. A loop with no sleep will freeze the browser.

**Audio glitches or dropouts?**
- Close other tabs and applications to free up CPU.
- Try a longer `sleep` value to reduce the number of simultaneous sounds.
- Chrome generally has the best WebAudio performance.
