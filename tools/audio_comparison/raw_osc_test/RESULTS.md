# Raw OSC Isolation Test Results

**Date:** 2026-04-01T06:33:16.259Z
**Branch:** feat/osc-bundle-timestamps

## Purpose

This test BYPASSES the entire Sonic Web engine (no SonicPiEngine, no SoundLayer,
no AudioInterpreter, no ProgramBuilder). It loads SuperSonic directly from CDN and
sends raw OSC commands with desktop-identical settings.

If the output is still ~2.3x louder, SuperSonic WASM is the source.
If the output matches desktop, our engine is adding gain.

## Test Configuration

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| pre_amp | 0.2 | Desktop default (NOT compensated) |
| amp | 6 | Desktop default |
| Sample | bd_tek | Same as desktop reference |
| Synthdef | basic_stereo_player | Same as desktop |
| BPM | 130 | Same as desktop |
| Pattern | x--x--x---x--x-- | Same as desktop |
| amp (synth) | 1.5 | Same as desktop |
| lpf (cutoff) | 130 | Same as desktop |
| out_bus | 0 | Same as desktop |

## Results

### Raw OSC Test (WASM, desktop settings)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 9.47s |
| Peak | 1.0000 |
| RMS | 0.3604 |
| Clipping (>0.95) | 2.69% |

### Desktop Reference (original Sonic Pi)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 11.31s |
| Peak | 0.6267 |
| RMS | 0.1881 |
| Clipping (>0.95) | 0.00% |

### Comparison

| Metric | Ratio (WASM / Desktop) |
|--------|----------------------|
| RMS | **1.92x** |
| Peak | **1.60x** |

### Per-Second RMS

| Second | WASM RMS | Desktop RMS | Ratio |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | N/Ax |
| 2 | 0.4351 | 0.2124 | 2.05x |
| 3 | 0.4601 | 0.2067 | 2.23x |
| 4 | 0.3638 | 0.1798 | 2.02x |
| 5 | 0.4326 | 0.2123 | 2.04x |
| 6 | 0.4298 | 0.2098 | 2.05x |
| 7 | 0.4183 | 0.2048 | 2.04x |
| 8 | 0.3765 | 0.1866 | 2.02x |
| 9 | 0.2544 | 0.2165 | 1.18x |
| 10 | 0.0000 | 0.1981 | 0.00x |

## Verdict

**SuperSonic WASM IS the source of the 1.9x louder output.**

Our engine code is NOT adding gain. With desktop-identical settings (pre_amp=0.2, amp=6)
and direct OSC to SuperSonic (bypassing SoundLayer, AudioInterpreter, ProgramBuilder),
the output is still 1.9x louder than desktop scsynth.

This confirms the finding in artifacts/ref/RESEARCH_WASM_OUTPUT_LEVEL.md:
scsynth WASM produces hotter raw output than desktop scsynth.

**Action:** File issue on samaaron/supersonic with this A/B data.
